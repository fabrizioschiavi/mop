The concept is to make more evident the important moment to invest using VOLUMES and LONG/SHORT contracts parameters.
Large bar means high volumes, small bars means low volumes.
The restricted grid simplify the understanding.
This combination can improve the probabilities of a good investment :)

The sample is set in [PragmataPro](http://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)™
